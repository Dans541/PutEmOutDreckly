## Original User Request:
I want to create an app called "Put 'Em Out Dreckly". It is an app used for Cornwall residents to remind them of when their bins are due. I want the app to be written is react/a cross platform code so app can be put on IOS and Android simultaneously. I want the theme to be green (same green as a recycling logo). I want the splash page of a bin (green background white bin). I want the user to be greeted with a page to enter their postcode, then a list pops up with addresses relevant to their postcode (the keyboard should autohide). I want them then to be able to "confirm their selection". Next page is the dashboard. It should be minimalistic and show when their bin collections are. I want them to be able to favourite addresses, so that they dont have to enter their address in everytime they start the app. I also want them to be able to choose when they receive notifications the day before their bin collections. They should be able to choose and set a time for when to receive the reminders. Please look at the photos, this is a mockup of the app I have already created. However, please feel free to make it more modern, sleeker and minimalistic. I want a dark mode theme too (which can be toggled on/off). I have written a custom API that speaks to the Cornwall Councils website.
